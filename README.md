Part of the forth coming <a html="http://www.justingest.com/research.html">Crossroads of Migration</a> research agenda, this map visualizes the movement of migrants from origin to destination countries. It is based on standardized 2013 United Nations data*, a compilation of demographic reports from 232 countries. To view a destination country's profile, single-click anywhere inside the country's borders or select the country from the drop-down menu in the 'Destination' tab. Hover the mouse over any stream to view origin-specific stock data. Streams turn white when touched and are otherwise colored according to the absolute number or proportion of migrant stock, as indicated in the 'Legend' tab. To zoom, double-click the map or use the arrows in the top right corner.
